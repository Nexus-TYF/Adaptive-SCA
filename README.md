# Adaptive SCA

Adaptive side-channel analysis on white-box block cipher implementations.

This repository is relevant to the paper "Adaptive Side-Channel Analysis Model and Its Applications to White-Box Block Cipher Implementations" by Yufeng Tang, Zheng Gong, Tao Sun, Jinhai Chen and Fan Zhang ([Inscrypt 2021](https://cst.qd.sdu.edu.cn/inscrypt_2021/index.htm)).

The folders contain two implementations:

1. Adaptive DCA on breaking Lee et al.'s improved masking white-box AES.

2. Adaptive DFA on breaking Lee et al.'s table redundant white-box AES.
